Cosmic Rays and Gamma Ray Bursts
================================
Astroparticle Physics revolves around phenomena that involve  
(astro)physics under the most extreme conditions.  
Black holes with masses a billion times greater than the mass  
of the Sun, accelerate particles to velocities close to the speed  
of light.  
The produced high-energy particles may be detected on Earth and as  
such provide us insight in the physical processes underlying these  
cataclysmic events. This is the arena of Cosmic Ray physics.  
 
The current understanding is that protons and electrons are the  
primary particles that are accelerated by electromagnetic fields at  
a cosmic accelerator site.  
Candidates for the production of the most energetic cosmic rays are  
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs).  
The current perception is that the majority of these objects have a  
similar inner engine, in which infalling matter and the likely presence  
of a strong magnetic field gives rise to relativistic shock wave acceleration  
in two back to back jets.  

One of the main objectives in cosmic ray studies is the detection of  
extraterrestrial high-energy neutrinos.  
Having no electrical charge and interacting only weakly with matter,  
neutrinos are special astronomical messengers. Only they can carry  
information from violent cosmological events at the edge of the Universe  
directly towards the Earth.  
Furthermore, since they are hardly hindered by intervening matter, they are  
the only messengers that can provide information about the central cores of  
the cosmic accelerators.  

As such, this new field of research, called Neutrino Astronomy, is poised to  
provide new discoveries now that large scale neutrino observatories like  
IceCube at the South Pole have become operational.  
The current situation may be compared with the advent of radio astronomy,  
which has led to unexpected discoveries like pulsars and many new insights.   

In this course we will focus on the identification of high-energy neutrinos from  
transient phenomena, i.e. Gamma Ray Bursts and flares of Active Galactic Nuclei,  
which are believed to be the most violent cosmic events.  
This high-energy neutrino component in the emitted fluxes allows us to investigate  
the nature of the progenitors and inner engines of these mysterious phenomena.
